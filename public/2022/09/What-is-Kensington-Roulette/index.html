      		<h1 id="What-is-Kensington-Roulette"><a href="#What-is-Kensington-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="What is Kensington Roulette?"></a>What is Kensington Roulette?</h1><p>Kensington Roulette is a new casino game that has been making waves in the online gambling world. The premise of the game is simple – you place a bet on a number, and if that number is selected when the ball lands in the roulette wheel, you win!</p>
<p>The game has generated a lot of buzz thanks to its unique gameplay and potential for big payouts. But what exactly makes Kensington Roulette so special? And how can you make the most of your betting opportunities?</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll take a closer look at Kensington Roulette and explain everything you need to know about this exciting new game. So read on to find out more!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-Kensington-Roulette"><a href="#How-to-Play-Kensington-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Kensington Roulette"></a>How to Play Kensington Roulette</h1><p>At its core, Kensington Roulette is a very simple game. You just need to pick a number and hope that the ball lands on it when the wheel stops spinning. If it does, you win!</p>
<p>There are 36 numbers in total, which are spread out across red and black slots on the roulette wheel. You can choose any number from 1-36, or alternatively bet on whether the ball will land in black or red slot.</p>
<p>The table below shows the odds for each type of bet:</p>
<p>For example, if you choose number 5 and the ball lands on it, you’ll win $36 chips (3 times your original bet). Conversely, if you bet on black and the ball ends up landing in a red slot, you’ll lose your chips.</p>
<h1 id="Special-Features-of-Kensington-Roulette"><a href="#Special-Features-of-Kensington-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Special Features of Kensington Roulette"></a>Special Features of Kensington Roulette</h1><p>As well as its simple gameplay, one of the things that makes Kensington Roulette so popular is its generous payouts. In addition to standard bets, there are also several special features that can earn you big payouts:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Doubler - This feature allows you to double your payout if your chosen number is selected. So if you select number 5 and it wins, you’ll receive double your original payout (6 times your original bet).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Quadrupler - This feature quadruples your payout if your chosen number is selected. So if you select number 5 and it wins, you’ll receive 24 times your original bet!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split Betting - This option allows you to place two bets on different numbers at the same time. For example, if you select numbers 10 and 15, then both of those numbers will be considered winning bets if either one comes up on the roulette wheel. This can increase your chances of winning significantly!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fortune Bet - This option allows you to wager even more money in order to win an even bigger payout. For example, if you select Fortune Bet with 10 chip stakes, then your payout would be multiplied by 100 if your chosen number comes up!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just some of the exciting features that make Kensington Roulette stand out from other casino games. With such generous payouts available, there’s never been a better time to give this game a try!</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-Kensington-Roulette-Game"><a href="#What-is-the-Kensington-Roulette-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is the Kensington Roulette Game?"></a>What is the Kensington Roulette Game?</h1><p>The Kensington Roulette Game is a variation of the classic casino game that can be played at home with friends. The game is played with a deck of cards and a die.</p>
<p>To start, each player is dealt 7 cards face down. The player then rolls the die. The number on the die corresponds to one of the seven cards in their hand. That card is then flipped over and placed in the middle of the players.</p>
<p>The player then draws another card from the deck and places it face up next to their other card. This forms two rows of 3 cards each, with the last card at the bottom of each row (see example below).</p>
<p>The aim of the game is to remove all of your cards from play as quickly as possible. You can do this by either matching the number on the die with the number on your card, or by playing a wild card. For example, if you roll a 4 and your card is also a 4, you can discard that card and draw another from the deck. If you roll a 2 and your card is also a 2, you can either discard that card and draw another, or play a wild card to match any number.</p>
<p>If you cannot immediately discard a card, you must place it at the bottom of one of the two rows (see example below). You cannot move cards between rows. If an entire row is filled, either with matching numbers or wildcards, then all those cards are removed from play and replaced with new cards from the deck. The game continues until one player has no cards remaining. That player is declared the winner!</p>

<h1 id="How-to-play-Kensington-Roulette"><a href="#How-to-play-Kensington-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="How to play Kensington Roulette?"></a>How to play Kensington Roulette?</h1><p>Kensington Roulette is a three-player game that can be played with either two or three decks of cards.

<li>Play one card from their hand, placing it face up in front of them. </li>
<li>optionally, discard one card from their hand and draw another from the deck to replace it. </li>
<li>If they cannot play any more cards then they must pick up all the cards in front of them, including those played by other players, and add them to their hand (this is known as ‘mucking’).</li>
</ol>
<p>The aim of the game is to make the best five-card poker hands using any combination of your own cards and those that have been played by other players. The rank of hands are shown below:</p>
<p>A Royal Flush is an ace high straight flush, e.g. A♠ K♦ Q♥ J♣ 10♥.<br>A Straight Flush is a five consecutive card straight flush, e.g. 4♦ 5♥ 6♠ 7♣ 8♠).<br>A Four of a Kind is four cards of the same rank, e.g. K♥ K♦ 10♣ 2♦ 3♥).<br>A Full House is three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, e.g 3♥ 3♦ 9♣ 6♥ 4♦).<br>A Flush is five cards of the same suit, e .g 7 ♥ 8 ♥ 9 ♥ 10 ♥ J ♥ .<br>A Straight is five consecutive cards not all in the same suit, e .g 4 ♦ 5 ♥ 6 ♣ 7 ♠ 8 ♦ .<br>Three Of A Kind is three cards of the same rank, e .g 2 ♦ 2 ♥ 3 ♣ 3 ♠ .<br>Two Pairs is two different pairs, e .g A ♦ A ♥ 2 ♣ 2 ♠ .<br>One Pair is two cards of the same rank, e .g Q ♠ Q ♥ 3♦ 4♣</p>
