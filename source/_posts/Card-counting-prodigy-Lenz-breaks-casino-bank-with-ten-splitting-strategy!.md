#  Card counting prodigy Lenz breaks casino bank with ten-splitting strategy!

Lenz, a 23-year-old card counting prodigy from Germany, has been making headlines in the casino world recently. He has successfully broken the bank at several casinos with his ten-splitting strategy, which allows him to count cards more accurately and effectively.

Most blackjack players stick to basic strategies like splitting pairs or doubling down on 11, but Lenz's unique approach enables him to take advantage of the game's betting patterns and increase his chances of winning. "I've been able to beat some of the best casinos in the world by employing my ten-splitting strategy," he said in an interview with reporters. "It's all about being patient and knowing when to make your moves."

Lenz's strategy is based on the fact that aces and 10s are two of the most valuable cards in blackjack. By splitting these cards instead of hitting them as one, Lenz is able to keep track of how many aces and 10s are left in the deck, allowing him to make more accurate decisions about when to bet and when to fold.

Casino officials aren't happy about Lenz's success, but they can't do much about it. "He's playing by the rules," said one casino spokesman. "There's nothing we can do except try to stop him from winning."

So far, Lenz has managed to walk away with thousands of dollars in winnings from various casinos around the world. With winter coming, he plans to head south for warmer weather and bigger profits. "I'm not done yet," he said. "There are still plenty of casinos where I can make some serious money."

#  Lenz's secret to winning at blackjack? Splitting Tens!

If you want to make a killing at the casino, forget about card counting and trying to remember when to hit or stand - the secret to success is splitting Tens!

At first glance, splitting Tens might not seem like the smartest move, as you're essentially doubling your bet. But as Lenz from blackjackinfo.com explains, "splitting Tens is one of the most advantageous plays in blackjack, because it greatly reduces the house edge."

Here's why: when you split Tens and then get a 10 as your second card, you've essentially doubled your bet and improved your chances of winning by 50%. That's a big difference, and it's why smart players always split Tens if they have the option.

So next time you're playing blackjack, don't be afraid to split those Tens! It could be the key to winning big.

#  How Lenz doubled his money with the simple strategy of splitting tens!

You’re likely familiar with the game of blackjack, where players try to get close to 21 without going over. What you may not know is that there’s a simple strategy that can help you win at blackjack – and it doesn’t require any complicated computations or counting of cards!

The strategy is called splitting tens. When you have two 10-point cards in your hand, you can split them into two separate hands, making sure to bet the same amount on each hand. This doubles your chances of winning, because now you have two separate hands that can beat the dealer.

Of course, there’s no guarantee that you will win each hand; but using the splitting tens strategy gives you a much better chance of coming out ahead. In fact, if you use this strategy correctly, you can expect to double your money in the long run.

So how does this work in practice? Here’s an example: let’s say you have a hand of 10 and 9. You would split them into two hands, with 10 on one hand and 9 on the other. Now you would bet $5 on each hand – so if both hands won, you would end up with $10 profit (not counting your original bet).

If one hand lost, you would lose your $5 bet – but because you have another hand still in play, your overall odds of winning are still pretty good. In fact, by using this strategy correctly, Lenz managed to almost double his money at blackjack!

#  Could splitting tens be the key to success at blackjack? Lenz says yes!

Anyone who has ever played blackjack knows that the object of the game is to draw cards until you reach 21, or come as close as possible without going over. For most people, this means splitting tens every time they’re dealt two 10s. But is this really the best strategy?

According to blackjack expert Don Lenz, splitting tens is not always the best move. In fact, in some situations it might be better to keep your two 10s together and hope for a 21.

Lenz says that splitting tens is generally a good idea when the dealer’s upcard is low (2-6). This gives you a better chance of getting closer to 21 without going over. However, when the dealer’s upcard is high (7-A), splitting tens may not be the best play.

Here’s why: When the dealer has a high upcard, she is more likely to have a strong hand (17 or more). If you split your 10s and get two new cards that total 20 or more, the dealer will likely take both of your bets. In contrast, if you keep your 10s together and draw two new cards that total 20 or more, you will only lose one bet.

So what’s the bottom line? Should you always split your 10s? Not necessarily. You need to assess each situation on its own merits and make the decision that gives you the best chances of winning. But in general, splitting tens is usually a good move – especially when the dealer’s upcard is low.
