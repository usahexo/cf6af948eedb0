#  The Secret to Winning at the Fireball Slot Machine

The key to winning at the Fireball slot machine is to understand how it works. This game is a three-reel, single-line slot machine that offers a variety of betting options. The player can bet one, two or three coins on each spin. The player can also choose to bet either on the center line or on the two side lines.

The object of the game is to match three symbols on the line. The symbols can appear anywhere on the reels, as long as they are touching each other horizontally or diagonally. If the player matches three symbols on the center line, he or she wins the jackpot. If the player matches three symbols on any of the side lines, he or she wins that amount multiplied by the number of coins wagered.

There are six different symbols in the game, and they are all different colors. The colors are red, blue, green, yellow, purple and pink. The symbol that pays out the most money is the yellow star. It pays out 800 coins for three symbols on the line. The next highest paying symbol is the purple diamond, which pays out 400 coins for three symbols on the line.

The key to winning at this game is to bet two or three coins per spin and to bet on both side lines. This will increase your chances of winning significantly.
