ACF Fiorentina, one of the leading soccer clubs in Italy, will participate in a blackjack tournament at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh next month. The tournament, which will take place from September 9-11, is expected to draw attention from both professional and recreational blackjack players.

The club's participation in the tournament is seen as a way to increase its profile in the United States and to promote its brand overseas. "The blackjack tournament at the Rivers Casino is a great opportunity for us to connect with our fans in the U.S. and promote our brand internationally," said Andrea Della Valle, owner of ACF Fiorentina.

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games worldwide and has been enjoyed by players for centuries. The game is simple to learn but can be difficult to master. In blackjack, players attempt to beat the dealer by drawing cards that total closer to 21 than the dealer's cards without going over 21.

The Rivers Casino is one of the largest casinos in Pennsylvania and offers a wide variety of gaming options, including blackjack, roulette, craps, slots, and poker.
