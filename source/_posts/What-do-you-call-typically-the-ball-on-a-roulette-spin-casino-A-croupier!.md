What is a croupier?

A croupier is a casino employee who helps run the games. They wear special outfits and deal cards or rolls dice for players at the gaming tables.

Croupiers are typically male, and usually from Europe or Asia. They must have excellent math skills, and be able to keep track of multiple games at once.

In addition to dealing cards or rolling dice, croupiers also often interact with customers, answering questions and helping resolve disputes. They must be able to maintain a positive attitude, even when things get hectic.
