#  How to Play 4 Card Poker at Online Casino Slingo

In order to play 4 Card Poker at an online casino, players need to first understand the basic rules of the game. The aim of 4 Card Poker is to beat the dealer’s hand by either having a higher ranked poker hand or by making a bet that the dealer’s hand will not qualify. In order to win, players must first place an Ante bet.

After the Ante has been placed, players are then dealt four cards face up. The dealer is then dealt four cards, but only two are turned over (the other two are placed face down). The player must then decide whether they want to raise (add an additional bet) or fold their hand (lose the Ante). If the player decides to raise, they must also put in an amount equal to the Ante.

If the dealer’s final two cards are Queen high or better, the dealer’s hand qualifies and players will compete against the dealer for the best hand. If the dealer doesn’t have Queen high or better, their hand does not qualify and players will automatically win this part of the bet (equal to their original Ante).
